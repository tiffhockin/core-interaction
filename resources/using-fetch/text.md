## Now what???

Some FAQ regarding Fetch.

**How do I make a new folder?**  
Click `New Folder` or drag a folder from your computer into the Fetch browser window.

**How do I name my folder or file?**  
Come up with a logical naming system for yourself using only *lowercase* letters, numbers, hyphens and underscores. <span class="note">Do not use spaces. Ever.</span> These rules apply to all files and folders you upload to your server.

**How do I upload files to my server?**  
Fetch works just like the Finder folders and windows on your computer. Drag any file or folder into the Fetch browser window. Your cursor should display a + to indicate that you are "adding" content to Fetch. Once you drop your files within the Fetch window, they will be uploaded to the server.

**How do I edit files once they're on my server?**  
You can download the file by dragging it out of Fetch and into a Finder folder. Once you have edited your file, you can update it on your server by re-uploading per the instructions above. Another way to edit files on Fetch is to select the file and click the `Edit` icon. The file will open in the default progam associated with that file type.

**What happens if I logout?**  
You'll have to log back in :(

**When I use Fetch, am I connected to the internet?**  
Yes
