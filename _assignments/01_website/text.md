# Create a simple website

`DUE WEEK 1`

A website can be defined as a destination (a site) on the internet.

Your simple website should be about an event that happened in the last ten days. It can be any event, small or large â€” such as: your toast fell on the floor, or a spaceship landed on the moon.

## Requirements

- You may use the following HTML tags: `p`, `br`, `b`, `em`, `hr`, `a` (link), `img`, `h1`, `h2`, `h3`. You may also use plain text (`.txt`).
- Your website should use space in an interesting way.*

**This could be horizontal, vertical or linear (time-based) space.*
