# Evocative HTML

`DUE WEEK 3`

Create an interesting and surprising interactive experience using only HTML.

## Requirements

- You may use *only* the following HTML tags: `h1`, `h2`, `h3`, `p`, `br`, `b`, `em`, `hr`, `a` (link), `img`, `audio`, form elements (&dagger;), and `iFrame` (&dagger;&dagger;). You may also use plain text (`.txt`).
- Your website should use space in an interesting way. This could be horizontal, vertical or linear (time-based) space.

----

**&dagger;** i.e., `radio`, `checkbox`, `button`, `text`. See [here](http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_forms.asp) for use.  

**&dagger;&dagger;** You may use `iFrame` so long as the `src` is an HTML page created by you, per the requirements above.
